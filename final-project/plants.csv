Your Bromeliad prefers indirect bright light like from a sunny eastern window. Too little light and the plant will not produce new pups and flowers, but too much light will burn the leaves.","Water:
Bromeliads are unique in that you water the center of the plant instead of the soil. Keep the center of the plant filled with water at all times – up to halfway. Every few weeks, empty any water, rinse and fill with fresh water. This helps prevent salt and mineral buildup. Only water the soil when it is 100% dry. When watering the soil, water until liquid flows through the drainage hole at the bottom of the pot and discard any water that has accumulated in the saucer.","Pet-Safe:
