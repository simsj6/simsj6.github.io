            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My day without my phone was spent traveling, so in a way, that made it easier to go without it. I didn't have as much down time as I would on a normal day, so I didn't need to fill my time with my phone. Jenny Odell's article, “What Twitter Does to Our Sense of Time,” is particularly relevant, since it's so easy to spend too much time scrolling on my phone unchecked, like how she found her phone to be like a separate stream of time. Usually, I like to read or do word games on my phone, but I had to look into other means of entertainment during my trip, like reading a physical book, writing a bit of my own, or simply enjoying being present in the moment (even if that moment was 10,000 feet in the air with dozens of strangers). I had sent my family my trip information so that they could still pick me up, and the rest of my day was spent with them, so I didn't have an explicit need for my phone. It was almost a bit relieving to not have to worry about what was happening on my phone since I couldn't use it. However, that didn't stop me from feeling anxious, particularly in public places alone. I've noticed before, but it became especially clear during this period that I rely on my phone heavily for safety reasons. Being disconnected without my usual means of calling for help if I need it was more stressful than I expected, but it also led to me being more vigilant of my surroundings, which is a good thing. It was also anxiety-inducing because I wasn't able to work on my homework, but the break was nice. I don't think I'm as dependent on my phone as others my age, but this assignment was still a good reality check that life is more than a screen and should be spent offline.
