                    <p>
                        At my job teaching college students, I'm occasionally mistaken for
                        one. I've found that a good way to make students take me seriously
                        on the first day is to mention that I remember a time <em>before the
                        internet</em>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course that's not true given a precise interpretation of what the internet
                        actually is. But I'm certainly old enough to remember PSA-like videos
                        coaxing the casual newbie into the exciting, if intimidating, world of
                        cyberspace. Such videos often begin the same way, with a middle-aged man
                        voicing all of the hypothetical questions you must be having: "But what
                        exactly <em>is</em> the internet?" "How much will it cost?" "Will I be any good at it?"
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks to enterprising individuals like Andy Baio and sites like Everything Is
                        Terrible, some of these early videos and TV shows have been extracted from
                        VHS tapes and are now available on YouTube.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warning: one can get pretty nostalgic watching these videos, in which the
                        internet is imagined as a neat, useful thing — not yet an omnipresent force
                        with unfathomable effects on our economy and sociality.
                    </p>
                    <h3>You'll be cruisin' the information superhighway in no time</h3>
                    <p>
                        As is often the case when we're grasping for explanations of the truly new,
                        the narrators of these videos compare the internet to an older structure: the
                        highway system. Some of the opening sequences of these videos show literal
                        highways or 3D visualizations of an "information superhighway." In one, a
                        friendly narrator steps out into a room full of highway signs; in another, a
                        laptop itself speeds down the highway toward a sign reading, "World Wide
                        Web: Next Exit."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What makes the highway metaphor sound so strange today is that it implies
                        the traversing of space and the passing of time. It's another version of the old
                        "series of tubes" idea, before the internet began to feel like a stifling sea of
                        instantaneity. In the 1990s, when internet didn't live in your pocket and all
                        around you, people with computers in suburban homes tended to have a
                        "computer room" (at least as I remember it). The computer was like a portal
                        that you approached when you wanted to travel somewhere. People "visited"
                        pages, they signed guestbooks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They also surfed. Scattered throughout these videos is the occasional surfing
                        montage, in which the director tries to make visiting a series of web pages
                        appear as dynamic and exciting as actual travel. This is not as easy task,
                        given a flat screen and a stationary surfer. The directors relied on 
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        surf music, zooming in and out really fast, and dragging windows around in crazy wiggly
                        patterns, always making sure to include some good "multimedia," like a 3D
                        .AVI file.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much as the internet was imagined as a superhighway, marketers of
                        internet how-to books and videos portrayed its individual capacities
                        as extensions of things we already knew: newspapers, address
                        books, and libraries (often in icon form, shown shooting out of a computer
                        screen). They sold an image of the computer as a handy "all in one" device
                        where the "all" included mostly boring, practical things. This reminds me of
                        the environment of Microsoft Bob, a short-lived Microsoft software product
                        that imagined the computer desktop as a house with rooms containing
                        calendars, checkbooks, a Rolodex, and a desk with pen and paper.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's funny and kind of heartbreaking about this is the way in which we
                        imagined that certain familiar things in life would simply get easer, without
                        the entire fabric of life itself undergoing almost indescribable change. In
                        "Using E-mail on the Internet," a man who looks like a parallel-universe
                        Jerry Seinfeld sits in a home office and describes a luxurious lifestyle of
                        working from home. "Telecommuting is what they call it," he says. "It's great
                        not to have to waste time sitting in a car on the way to work. Instead I sit
                        here with a coffee and a bagel, getting work done." The world is at his
                        fingertips. Of course, this is decades before we would need terms for digital
                        labor and the gig economy, and before Franco Berardi described such
                        always-connected labor as "fractals of time and pulsating cells of labor ...
                        switched on and off in the large control room of global production." Parallel-
                        universe Jerry Seinfeld doesn't know about email yet, only E-Mail.

                    <p>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One last thing that highlights the newness of the internet in these videos is
                        the occasional reference to "netiquette," or a set of rules to help the viewer
                        avoid making an ass of themselves on the superhighway. In Safe Surfin' —
                        starring 90s kid stars like Taran Smith (Home Improvement), Jenna Leigh
                        Greene (Sabrina the Teenage Witch), and Irene Ng (The Mystery Files of Shelby
                        Woo) — Olympic gymnast Kerri Strug tells us that she loves surfing the net
                        and exploring chat rooms. But sometimes, she sees things she doesn't like. "If
                        someone says something that makes you feel unsafe or funny... leave the
                        chat room or log off altogether," she advises. "Whatever you do, don't
                        respond."

                    <p>
                        The first time that David Bohnett heard about the internet, he knew 
                        that this was going to be a technology that was about to change the 
                        world. Today, David is a philanthropist and tech entrepreneur, but 
                        back in the early 1990s he really wanted to get on the ground floor 
                        of this brand new medium. Bohnett and his business partner, a man 
                        named John Rezner, decided in order to be a part of this digital 
                        revolution they would found an internet company that hosted websites. 
                        The plan was straightforward enough: the pair would provide the 
                        online space and some basic tools so that individuals or companies 
                        could build their own webpage. And the company would host those pages 
                        on its servers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They called their company Beverly Hills Internet, and Bohnett says that 
                        they were doing okay at first. They were starting to get some visitors to 
                        its website, but John and David found it difficult to get the kind of 
                        sustainable traffic that they really wanted… because of one huge early 90s 
                        problem: most people did not understand what the internet was.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nobody really understood at the time what it meant to create a worldwide 
                        web of these kinds of connections where all computers. were talking with 
                        one another and sharing information," explains Bohnett, "so I had the challenge 
                        both trying to explain to my friends what I was trying to do and the wider 
                        world at the same time." It wasn't that long ago that people had to make an 
                        enormous leap from a world with essentially no internet to trying to 
                        conceptualize what a globally connected computer network meant, or what they 
                        would even do with it. Before search engines like Google, or social networks, 
                        or apps, the web seemed like this confusing, nebulous blob of information. 
                        It was this strange, new technology that was hard to wrap our brains around.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because David ran an internet company, his business depended on users having 
                        some grasp of what the internet was. So it was his challenge to get people 
                        comfortable on the web. And one day in 1994, it just came to him. His hosting 
                        site didn't need a technological innovation, it needed a conceptual one. Users 
                        needed a new way of navigating the web. So he sketched out a plan to make his 
                        website feel more like a real neighborhood. "You'd go to a two-dimensional 
                        representation of a neighborhood where you would see streets and blocks. You 
                        would see icons that represented houses […] and you would actually pick an 
                        address that you wanted to create your website. You had a sense that you were 
                        joining a neighborhood," says David.

                    <p>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn't want people to think of the web as a thing you logged onto, but more 
                        like a physical place to dwell in—like a house. Your new webpage was that house, 
                        in an online community of your choosing. This was all a new frontier, and you 
                        were in a way a virtual homesteader. David and his team were endowing users with 
                        a sense of digital manifest destiny one virtual neighborhood at a time. It was 
                        such a revolutionary idea that David and his partner decided to chuck out the whole 
                        "Beverly Hills Internet" name and change their company to something that fully 
                        leaned into the spatial metaphor they were creating. They called it GeoCities.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Digital Manifest Destiny</h3>
                    <p>
                        "The story of GeoCities is just a fantastic parallel for a real building—for something 
                        that was conceived of and created to model real life, but in the domain of cyberspace… 
                        and which ultimately had a catastrophic and dramatic fall in the end," says James 
                        Crawford, author of Fallen Glory: The Lives and Deaths of History's Greatest Buildings. 
                        "GeoCities was creating these communities and then conceptualizing them as places you 
                        could go as neighborhoods on the net. So you could be a citizen of a country, and you 
                        could then be a netizen of somewhere like Geocities." The website was a collection of 
                        metropolises, each with their own neighborhoods built around shared interests. There was 
                        a region called Heartland where you could discuss tractor models or Pettsburgh where you 
                        could talk endlessly about your cats, or you could an endless amount of fan sites 
                        dedicated to Dana Scully in Area 51.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as they established this spatialized version of the web, GeoCities really began 
                        to click for people. Bohnett wanted users who built their webpages in GeoCities to feel 
                        like part of a community. "I think a lot of that comes from my own experiences as a gay 
                        man and coming out and meeting other lesbian and gay people and understanding the power 
                        of meeting others of your own identity," explains David.
